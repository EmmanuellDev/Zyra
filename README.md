## ✨ Key Features

- 📌 **Raise Issues with Proofs** – Users can upload proofs for their issues.  
- 🗂 **Decentralized Storage** – Proofs are stored in **IPFS**, with the hash mapped in **Firebase Realtime DB** alongside the user’s wallet address.  
- 🤖 **AI-driven Analysis** – Each issue is analyzed across **five categories**:  
  - ⚖️ Fairness Analysis  
  - 📊 Impact Analysis  
  - 💰 Resource Analysis  
  - 🌱 Sustainability Analysis  
  - ⚠️ Disadvantages  

- 🧠 **Additional AI Insights:**  
  - AI Suggestion

  - Timestamp  

- 🗳 **DAO Voting System** – Token-based governance where **vote weight = number of tokens held**.  
  - Example: Holding **5 tokens** → **vote weight = 5**.  

- 🔒 **Secure & Transparent** – Immutable storage + AI-powered objectivity.
